# OpenAI_Assistants_ApiSample(Hoppscotch)

Note the API version in the header. Some will be v1 and some will be v2. This is because some items are still in the Beta version.
To use this JSON to import into Hoppscotch, you need to set the openai_api_key in the Authorization and create the environment below:
1. openai_file_id
2. openai_assistant_id
3. openai_thread_id
4. openai_run_id
5. openai_vector_id

You don't need to insert the value. It will automatically input the value after running the API.
